## Steps

1. Install (see in readme.md for setup installation)
2. Install additional dependencies `npm install --legacy-peer-deps @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei maath react-tilt react-vertical-timeline-component @emailjs/browser framer-motion`
   - `--legacy-peer-deps` -> one of packages we'll be using, specifically `react-tilt` uses older versions of react, this is something you'll use often when using some older packages
   - `@react-three/fiber` -> react based 3js library that's allow us to create 3js code in a react fashion
   - `@react-three/drei`
   - `maath` for math utility functions
   - `react-tilt` -> provide some animation when hovering over our cards
   - `react-vertical-timeline-component` -> for experience similar timeline to the one on LinkedIn
   - `@emailjs/browser`
   - `framer-motion`
   - `react-router-dom` -> since we're using Next.Js, we don't need to install this
3. next -> setup starting project
